    "In the student sample program files for this chapter, you will find a text file named GasPrices.txt. The file contains the weekly average prices for a gallon of gas in the United States, beginning on April 5th, 1993, and ending on August 26th, 2013. Figure 8-7 shows an example of the first few lines of the file’s contents: Figure 8-8\n",

    "MM is the two-digit month, DD is the two-digit day, and YYYY is the four-digit year. Price is the average price per gallon of gas on the specified date.\n",

    "- Average Price Per Year: Calculate the average price of gas per year, for each year in the file. (The file’s data starts in April of 1993, and it ends in August 2013. Use the data that is present for the years 1993 and 2013.)\n",
